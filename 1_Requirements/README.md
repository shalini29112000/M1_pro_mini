# **ENCRYPTION -DECRYTPTION on Cryptography FOR [RSA]**

## **`INTRODUCTION`**

[RSA]

  RSA Algorithm is used to encrypt and decrypt data in modern computer systems and other electronic devices. RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm as it creates 2 different keys for the purpose of encryption and decryption. It is public key cryptography as one of the keys involved is made public. RSA stands for Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman who first publicly described it in 1978.

  RSA makes use of prime numbers (arbitrary large numbers) to function. The public key is made available publicly (means to everyone) and only the person having the private key with them can decrypt the original message.

## **`OBJECTIVE`**

a) To build a system that can receive input freom the user and generate automatically output in easy way and short time.

b) To build an algorithm which detects the security of the message all times round. 

c) Combination of Ciphering Algorithm and Rivest Shamir Adleman Algorithm for Securing Document Files and Text Messages

d) To build Confidentiality, Authenticity, Integrity of information

e) To protect the data against corruption

## **`BENEFITS`**

Cryptography is an essential information security tool. It provides the four most basic services of information security −

    `Confidentiality` − Encryption technique can guard the information and communication from unauthorized revelation and access of information.

    `Authentication` − The cryptographic techniques such as MAC and digital signatures can protect information against spoofing and forgeries.

    `Data Integrity` − The cryptographic hash functions are playing vital role in assuring the users about the data integrity.

    `Non-repudiation` − The digital signature provides the non-repudiation service to guard against the dispute that may arise due to denial of passing message by the sender.

All these fundamental services offered by cryptography has enabled the conduct of business over the networks using the computer systems in extremely efficient and effective manner.

## **`4W's and 1H`**

### Who:

The daily mobile user to a military, to a space shuttle.

### What:
 
The Cryptography to ensure encryption and decrytion of any real time applications are use to validate safety in the data transmission without being hacked by employing  cipher techniques

### When:

It is can be applied when the plain text is being transmitted over the channel after encountering certain ciphering of the text to ensure security and authenticity of the sender and the receiver.

### Where:

It can be applied from the Underwater Sensor Communication to the satellite application. From a household use to the worldwide application

### Who:

This project is implemented to nullify security issuing, return the text essage after being encrypted.

## **`SWOT ANALYSIS`**

### Strengths:

a)Simple and Easy to use.

b) Sharing public key to users is easy.

c) Tracking the rhythmn of the code is tedious for higher prime number.

d) Highly Secure, Scalable & Reliable.

e) RSA algorithm is safe and secure for transmitting confidential data.



### Weakness:

a) Data stored is prone to Cyber Attacks

b) Tracking rhythmn of the prime number <23 is high

c) It has slow data transfer rate due to large numbers involved.

d) It requires third party to verify the reliability of public keys sometimes.

e) High processing is required at receiver’s end for decryption.

## **`OPPORTUNITEIS`**

Efforts to lower such costs have been met with success in recent years, and new innovations on the horizon will soon offer organizations better ways to protect themselves from both current and emerging cybersecurity threats. IBM conveyed that message during its recent “Future of Cryptography” online event, citing advances in three critical emerging areas of data privacy and encryption: 

  ~ Confidential computing, 
  ~ Quantum-safe cryptography
  ~ Fully homomorphic encryption.
